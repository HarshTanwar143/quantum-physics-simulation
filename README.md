# ⚛️ Quantum Physics Simulation

An interactive, educational web application that helps users visualize and understand fundamental quantum mechanics concepts — including **Superposition**, **Entanglement**, and **Wave Interference** — through animated simulations.

Built with **React.js**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced by **Framer Motion** animations. 🧠

## 🧮 DSA Concepts Used

- **Matrix Operations:**  
  Simulating quantum gate transformations on qubits using 2×2 matrices.

- **Bit Manipulation:**  
  Used to simulate qubit state measurement and entangled outcomes.

## 📘 What is Quantum Physics?

Quantum Physics is a fundamental branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — such as atoms and subatomic particles. It defies classical logic and introduces some of the most fascinating and counterintuitive concepts in science.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

- **🌀 Superposition**  
  A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once. For example, a qubit can be in both `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` simultaneously — until measured.

- **🔗 Entanglement**  
  Two or more particles become linked such that the state of one instantly determines the state of the other — no matter how far apart.

- **🌊 Interference**  
  Quantum particles act like waves and their amplitudes interfere, forming complex patterns that affect measurement outcomes.
